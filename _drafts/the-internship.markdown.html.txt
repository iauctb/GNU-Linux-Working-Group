Title: 
---

For the past couple of months I’ve been guiding a very passionate and hard working university freshman under the name of internship. But since there is not much actual work to do he spends most of the time learning. 

My responsibility is to tell him what he should learn and do. Or to see what skills would be the most valuable to him and let him know and provide him with learning material. 

I tried my best to %%% most relevant and up-to-date skills.
