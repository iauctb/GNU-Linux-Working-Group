I feel the need to have a mentee.

To teach him all the right things he must do even if I’m not doing them myself. That might me help me to actully do them. Apart from that I feel someone should have done the same for me but they never did. Somethings are not that obvious to those who are growing up as much as grown-ups think they are. I should act on my knowledge before I forget what I wished I've been told growing up.

so many ‘I’s in my writings. Doesn't feel good. Feels so self-centered. But maybe that's just the way English language is.
