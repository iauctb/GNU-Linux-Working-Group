title: Nightly walks
---

A friend and I live in the same neighborhood and lately we decided to go for a walk from time to time. Though it’s too soon to say it’s a thing that we’re gonna always do, I liked it a lot so far and am motivated to continue it.

Tonight we simply couldn’t get ourselves to end our discussion after two hours. It’s so refreshing talking about some deeper matters with an old friend.
